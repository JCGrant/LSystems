# Lindenmayer Systems

## Disclaimer
This code started out as a Haskell exercise from Imperial College London's Computing Department.

For any future IC student who has arrived here, hoping they can copy some answers, it's unlikely you will find any value because:

- I have removed the answers to `trace1` and `trace2` and replaced them with a different solution which won't get you any marks.
- A lot of my other solutions use built in Haskell functions which you are expected to implement yourself. Copying these will lose you marks.
- The underlying code given by Tony (blessed be his name) has been modified a fair amount. My `Graphics.hs` has been refactored to support 3D models.
